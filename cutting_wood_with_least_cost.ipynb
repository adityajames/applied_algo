    "### cutting a piece of wood such that the total cutting cost of the wood is the least\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example, a length of wooden log is 10 and the cuts need to be done at [2; 4; 7] then cutting at 2, then at 4, then at 7 would lead to a cost of 10 + 8 + 6 = 24. First cut would be made at 2 for the wooden log of length 10. Hence the first cut costs 10 units. Now the wooden log length is 8 units. Second cut is made on the remaining wooden log of length 8. Hence the second cut costs 8 units. Third cut is made on the remaining wooden log of length 6 units. Similarily third cut is made when the wooden log length is 6 Instead if the cutting order is changed first it is done at 4, then at 2 , then at 7, that would lead to a cost of 10 + 4 + 6 = 20"
